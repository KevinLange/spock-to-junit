# spock-to-junit

The idea is to provide a converter from spock to junit 5 tests

# why

My work is generally within java projects

* i dont like the idea to have multiple languages for the implementation and the test
* spock/groovy allows you to do things that are not allowed in java
* there will probably be some problems when migrating to java >11
